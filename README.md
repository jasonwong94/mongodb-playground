# mongodb-playground
A play around with le MEAN (Mongo-Express-Angular-Node) stack. The product is a simple job tracker that will allow you to keep track of job applications. Suggested thoughts include:
* ability to prioritize job and set deadlines
* visual break down of job applications (added, submitted, interviewed, rejected)
